I'm a Biostatistician / Data Analyst working at [A.J. Drexel Autism Institute](https://drexel.edu/autisminstitute/) Policy and Analytics Center (PAC). The mission of the PAC is to utilize research methods and innovative analytic strategies to support the development of effective social and health policy in cities, states, and across the US.

I graduated from Columbia University in 2019 with a master degree in Biostatistics. I also had a certificate in Advanced Epidemiology. My research was on the topic [cognitive reserve](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-is-cognitive-reserve) in Alzheimer's disease, and performing neuro-image data analysis at [New York State Psychiatric Institute](https://nyspi.org/).

I graduated from Michigan State University with a BS in biochemisty and molecular biology in 2016. I was doing plant research at that time, and studied gene RHD3 for years.

I'm a Python, R and SAS programmer. I'd like to be a data scientist!
