I'm a Biostatistician / Data Analyst working at [A.J. Drexel Autism Institute](https://drexel.edu/autisminstitute/) Policy and Analytics Center (PAC). The mission of the PAC is to utilize research methods and innovative analytic strategies to support the development of effective social and health policy in cities, states, and across the US.

I graduated from Columbia University in 2019 with a master degree in Biostatistics. I also had a certificate in Advanced Epidemiology. My research was on the topic [cognitive reserve](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-is-cognitive-reserve) in Alzheimer's disease, and performing neuro-image data analysis at [New York State Psychiatric Institute](https://nyspi.org/).

I graduated from Michigan State University with a BS in biochemisty and molucular biology in 2016. I was doing plant research at that time, and studied gene RHD3 for years.

I'm a Python, R and SAS programmer. I've decided to summarize and update the codes I'm using daily.
I'd like to be a data scientist!

Here's a working sample Dashboard, [take a look](dashboard.html)!

Summary:

1. Bar Chart: Total Snowfall in Winter Each Year.\
From the plot, we can see that year 2010 has the highest amount of snowfall overall.\
January have relatively stable and large amount of snowfall, while November have the lowest amount of snowfall in winter. \
The other three months in winter have a wider range of snowfall.

2. Lineplot: Average Highest and Lowest Temperature Each Year.\
From the plot, we can see that the average highest temperature and lowest temperature each year have the same pattern across years.\
The peck of both happened in 1998, with average highest temperature at 15.38 celsius degree and minimum temperature at 4.61 celsius degree.\
Both highest and lowest temperature are relatively stable across years.

3. Boxplot: Total Precipitation Each Year.\
Year 2010 has the highest median precipitation around 30.21k mm, with a highest monthly precipitation (outlier) at 67.83k.\
The total precipitation was stable before 2007, and increased in 2008, 2009 and 2010.
